    "In LoopAnchor manuscript we showed that DeepAnchor model can be trained with different type of CBSs. Here we provide the reproducible code for this part. \n",

    "We included 3 cell lines (GM12878, H1, K562), and 3 different CBSs (associated with ChromHMM insulator, Cohesin ChIP-seq peaks, Cohesin ChIA-PET loops). The input files have been put under ./loopanchor/data/three_type_CBSs.\n",
